Dynamic Zero-Based Budget Planner

Welcome to your personal, standalone budget planner! This application is designed to help you manage your finances using the zero-based budgeting method, where every dollar has a job. It's a powerful tool to track your income, expenses, savings, and debt repayment progress on a weekly and monthly basis.

The app is completely private and runs in your browser. All data is saved on your local device, not on any server.
Key Features

    Calendar-Based Budgeting: Navigate your finances by month. The app automatically rolls your balance forward, providing a continuous, long-term view of your money.

    Dynamic Transactions: Easily add income or expenses as they happen. Your budget recalculates in real-time with every entry.

    Goal Management:

        Savings Goals: Create and track your progress toward specific savings targets.

        Debt Snowball: Add your debts, and the app will automatically sort them from smallest to largest. It suggests payments based on the snowball method to help you build momentum and get out of debt faster.

    Smart Weekly Suggestions: At the end of each week, the app analyzes your balance and upcoming bills to suggest how much you can safely allocate to your savings and debt goals.

    Confirmable Allocations: Instead of just suggestions, you can confirm your weekly savings, debt, or investment allocations. This logs them as transactions, ensuring your budget is always 100% accurate.

    Collapsible Sections: A clean, organized interface where each section can be expanded or collapsed to keep your view focused.

    Offline First: Designed to be "installed" on your iPhone's home screen and work perfectly even without an internet connection.
