Dynamic Budget Planner

Welcome to your personal, offline-first Dynamic Budget Planner! This application is designed to help you implement a zero-based budget, where every dollar has a job. Track your income, expenses, and progress towards your financial goals like paying off debt and building savings.

The app is built to be a standalone tool that runs directly in your browser and saves all your data on your device, ensuring your financial information remains private and accessible even without an internet connection.
Core Features

    Offline-First Functionality: All core budgeting features work without an internet connection. Your data is yours and stays on your device.

    Zero-Based Budgeting: Plan where every dollar will go. The app helps you allocate your surplus to your goals, ensuring your "Amount to Allocate" for the month is zero.

    Calendar Navigation: Easily move between months to plan for the future or review past spending. The app automatically rolls your balance over from one month to the next.

    Dynamic Weekly Planning: The app breaks your month down into actionable weeks. Each week, you'll get a summary of your cash flow and suggestions for how much you can safely allocate to your goals.

    Interactive Goal Tracking:

        Savings Goals: Create specific savings goals, set target amounts, and track your progress with visual bars.

        Debt Snowball: List your debts and let the app help you tackle them with the snowball method, automatically applying extra payments to the smallest debt first.

    Confirmable Allocations: Instead of just guessing, you can confirm your weekly savings, debt, or investment allocations. The app logs these as transactions and updates your goals, keeping your budget perfectly accurate.

Getting Started: Your First Budget

    Set Your Starting Balance: Click on the "Starting Balance" in the "Monthly Snapshot" section to set the amount of money you're beginning with for the current month.

    Add Your Transactions: Use the "Add a Transaction" form to enter all your expected income (paychecks) and recurring expenses (bills, groceries, etc.) for the month. Be sure to set the correct dates.

    Set Up Your Goals:

        Go to "Manage Savings Goals" to add your savings targets (e.g., Emergency Fund).

        Go to "Manage Debts" to list all your outstanding debts with their current balances.

    Follow the Plan: Each week, check the "Weekly Summary" for suggestions. Use the "Confirm" buttons to log your savings transfers and debt payments as you make them.

    Review and Adjust: At the end of the month, check the "End-of-Month Review" to see your progress and get ready for the next month!

How to Use on Your iPhone (for Offline Access)

To get the full app experience with an icon on your home screen, you first need to host the app files online.

    Save the Files: Save the index.html, sw.js, and manifest.json files to a single folder on your computer.

    Upload: Compress that folder into a .zip file. Go to a free hosting service like tiiny.host, upload your .zip file, and get your unique URL.


    Add to Home Screen: Open that URL in Safari on your iPhone, tap the "Share" icon, and then tap "Add to Home Screen." You'll now have a "My Budget" app icon that works offline.
